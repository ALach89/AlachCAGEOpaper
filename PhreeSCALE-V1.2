Version of Phreeqc: phreeqc-3.1.7-9213

The input file is built as a Phreeqc input file (see Phreeqc manual) except that there are seven keywords in more in SELECTED_OUTPUT:
		• CPSTAN(“i”): the standard partial molal heat capacity of the aqueous species i at infinite dilution
		• ENTHALAPP: the apparent relative molal enthalpy computed by Pitzer equations
		• CPAPP: the apparent molal heat capacity of the solution computed by Pitzer equations
		• CPSOL: the mass heat capacity of the aqueous solution computed by Pitzer equations (J/g/K)
		• VSTAN(“i”): standard partial molal volume of the species i at infinite dilution
		• VAPP: the apparent molal volume computed by Pitzer equations
		• DENSOL: the density of the aqueous solution computed by Pitzer equations (g/cm3)

Other modifications: 
- Database (.dat): 
		• added HKF keyword in the SOLUTION_SPECIES block: 7 HKF parameters (a1, a2, a3, a4, c1, c2, w(Tr,Pr)) founded in Thermoddem (Blanc et al, 2012) and one additional parameter corresponding to nui (the number of moles of ions formed by the complete dissociation of one molecule of solute)
		• added the keywords: B0V, B1V, B2V, C0V, LAMDAV, ZETAV, MUV, PSIV, ETAV with the following temperature dependance
	YV = a0/T + a1 + a2*T + a3*T*T + a4*T*T*T + a5*P_bar (format Phutela and Pitzer, J. Chem. Eng. Data, 31, 320-327 (1986))

- Sources :  
		• modification of the temperature dependence of interection parameter (Y)
		• temperature derivative of the interaction paramater (YL=dY/dT et YJ=dYL/dT+(2/T)*YL)
		• All apparent properties and all equations necessary for computing were also added (the temperature and pressure derivatives of the dielectric constant and the density of pure water, the heat capacity of water, the standard partial molal heat capacity and the volume of aqueous species at infinite dilution, etc.)
		• Johnson et al. (1992) equations are added for the compute of CPSTAN and VSTAN
		• correction of osmotic coefficient to take into account the partial dissociation: OSMO_DT = OSMO_DP * somme_mi / somme_nui_mi
